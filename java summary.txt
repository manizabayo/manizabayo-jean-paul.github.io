java is the compiled language that is translated into binary numbers/machine language. 
while the javascript is the interpreted language  no need of being translated.

example of the interpreted language: java script,python,etc...
example of the compiled language is:c,c++,etc...


 this is how to put tyhe java script externally, ,, we open the new java document and do all the javascript codes  and save it with the extension 
of the js. then we link that java with the html ,by <script src=" (script.js)the pathg of the java scrpt codes" defer></script> . this is when it is the head section. but when 
 but when it is  under the html code at the end, we don't need to use the defer in the opening tag of the javascript.
